LegacyOrderService: Developer Assessment
Overview
This small C# (.NET 8) console application was built to meet immediate needs, but the business anticipates substantial growth. The codebase will need to scale to support new features, higher throughput, and possible system integrations.
		Identify and fix bugs or runtime issues
		Refactor poor architecture and code smells
		Apply appropriate design patterns and modern C# best practices
		Improve performance, resilience, scalability and testability
		Make decisions based on real-world engineering tradeoffs
This is not a contrived code challenge: treat this like a system you've inherited in a real production codebase.

What You'll Be Working With
You’ll be handed off a real codebase: no documentation, no detailed requirements. Just a console application that works (mostly), but creaks in all the ways legacy systems often do.
What you choose to improve, clean up, fix, or modernize is up to you. If you spot something broken, fix it. If you notice code that hurts your eyes, refactor it. If you feel the design is fragile, evolve it.
We’re not testing how well you follow a checklist we’re evaluating how you think and what you prioritize.

Submission Guidelines
	1.	Create a public GitHub repository using the provided codebase as your starting point.
	2.	For every logical change (e.g., bug fix, refactor, performance improvement), open a separate pull request.
	3.	Write clear PR titles and descriptions so we can understand your intent and thought process.
We’re interested in your decisions, not just the final result. This makes your reasoning transparent and easy to review.
